        <h3>Hackathon</h3>
        <p>
          During my campus life, I have experienced many memorable moments. One of the most memorable moments was during a hackathon organized by the USMC. We had to work in a team and provide a prototype within a limited time frame. It was a very challenging and intense experience, but it was also very rewarding when we finally presented the prototype.
